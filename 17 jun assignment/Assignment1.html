            <h3>Why I Love Photography</h3>
            <p><b>Photography</b> has been my <i>passion</i> for over five years now. It's not just about <u>taking pictures</u>; it's about <b>capturing moments</b> that tell stories and evoke emotions. Every time I pick up my camera, I feel like I'm seeing the world through a different lens - literally and figuratively.</p>
            
            <p>The beauty of photography lies in its ability to <i>freeze time</i> and preserve memories that would otherwise fade away. Whether I'm shooting <b>landscapes</b> during golden hour, <u>portraits</u> of friends and family, or <i>street photography</i> in bustling cities, each click of the shutter captures a unique perspective of the world around me.</p>
            
            <p>What makes photography truly special is its <b>universal language</b>. A powerful image can transcend cultural and linguistic barriers, speaking directly to the heart. Through my lens, I've learned to appreciate the <i>small details</i> in everyday life - the way light filters through leaves, the expressions on people's faces, and the stories hidden in ordinary moments.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p class="text-left"><b>Albert Einstein</b> was born on <i>March 14, 1879</i>, in <u>Ulm, Germany</u>. From an early age, he showed an extraordinary curiosity about the natural world. His parents, Hermann and Pauline Einstein, recognized his intellectual potential and encouraged his education.</p>
            
            <p class="text-center">Despite facing challenges in traditional schooling, Einstein's <b>independent thinking</b> and <i>mathematical genius</i> became evident during his teenage years. He taught himself advanced mathematics and physics, often questioning the established scientific theories of his time.</p>
            
            <h2>Major Achievements</h2>
            <p class="text-right">In <b>1905</b>, Einstein published his <i>Special Theory of Relativity</i>, which revolutionized our understanding of space and time. This <u>groundbreaking work</u> introduced the famous equation <b>E = mcÂ²</b>, establishing the relationship between energy and mass.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p class="text-center"><b>Nobel Prize in Physics (1921)</b>: Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which laid the foundation for quantum theory.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Later Life and Legacy</h2>
            <p class="text-left">Einstein's <i>General Theory of Relativity</i>, published in <b>1915</b>, further transformed physics by describing gravity as a curvature of spacetime. His work continues to influence modern physics, from <u>black hole research</u> to <b>GPS technology</b>.</p>
            
            <p class="text-center">Beyond his scientific contributions, Einstein was also a <i>humanitarian</i> and <b>peace advocate</b>. He used his fame to speak out against war and promote international cooperation. His legacy extends far beyond physics, inspiring generations to think creatively and question the status quo.</p>

            <p>My day begins at <b>6:30 AM</b> with a refreshing glass of water and some light stretching. I believe in starting the day with <i>positive energy</i>, so I spend the first 30 minutes practicing <u>meditation</u> and setting my intentions for the day. After that, I enjoy a healthy breakfast while catching up on the latest news or reading a chapter from my current book.</p>
            
            <h2>Afternoon</h2>

            <p>The afternoon is dedicated to <b>productive work</b> and learning. I focus on my main tasks between <i>1:00 PM</i> and <u>4:00 PM</u>, taking short breaks every hour to maintain concentration. During these breaks, I might take a quick walk, practice some photography, or simply step away from the screen to rest my eyes.</p>
            
            <h2>Evening</h2>

            <p>Evenings are for <b>relaxation</b> and <i>personal development</i>. I usually spend time with family, work on creative projects like photography, or engage in hobbies that bring me joy. Before bed, I practice <u>gratitude</u> by reflecting on the day's accomplishments and planning for tomorrow. I aim to be in bed by <b>10:30 PM</b> to ensure adequate rest.</p>
